# FireFacts

Built a California wildfire website using ReactJS which can be found at https://ikeg225.github.io/firefacts/. This website covers five different categories - fire preparation, fire ecology, emergency fire protocols, fire recovery, and how to get involved in helping with wildfires. It is meant to serve as a resource for people to use to learn more about California wildfires and how they can stay safe when one happens. Each of the categories list commonly asked questions which contain detailed answers and link to further resources for users to learn more about.
